Unit Types and Detailed Area Analysis

We understand that space is the ultimate luxury. Below is a detailed breakdown of our unit types, focusing on the specific area and spatial experience of each room.

3 BHK Type 1 (The Grand Layout)
This is our flagship expansive layout designed for large families who appreciate open spaces.
Living Room Area Analysis: The Living Room measures 110 x 160. This translates to roughly 176 square feet of dedicated entertainment space, wide enough to accommodate a large L-shaped sofa and a separate entertainment unit without feeling cluttered.
Dining and Kitchen Area: The Dining and Kitchen area combined measures 100 x 160. This provides approximately 160 square feet of culinary space, allowing for a 6-seater dining table next to a spacious kitchen platform.
Master Bedroom Area: The Master Bedroom is a generous 126 x 110. It is designed for King-sized comfort, with enough room for a large wardrobe. It features a spacious attached toilet (60 x 69) and a private Standing Balcony for ventilation.
Second Bedroom: Measures 110 x 120, making it larger than standard bedrooms, perfect for children or guests. It also includes an attached toilet (60 x 69) and a balcony.
Guest Bedroom: A comfortable 100 x 120 room, suitable for a study or parents' room.
Storage: Includes a dedicated Store room (53 x 46) to keep your home organized.

3 BHK Type 2 (The Efficient Luxury)
This layout offers the same grand living experience as Type 1 but with optimized utility spaces attached to the bedrooms.
Living and Dining: Identical to Type 1, offering the same 176 sq ft Living area and 160 sq ft Dining space.
Master Bedroom Area: Measures 126 x 110. The key difference is the attached toilet, which is deeper but narrower (46 x 76), utilizing space efficiently.
Second Bedroom: Measures 110 x 120 with an attached toilet of 46 x 79.
Guest Bedroom: Measures 100 x 120 with an attached toilet of 46 x 49.
Summary: Type 2 is ideal if you prefer the same bedroom sizes but want a slightly different bathroom configuration.

2 BHK Type 1 (Smart Spacious Living)
Designed for nuclear families, this 2 BHK defies the norm by offering 3 BHK-sized living spaces.
Living Room Area Analysis: An impressive 110 x 163. This is actually larger than the 3 BHK living room, offering nearly 180 square feet of lounge space. It opens to a Standing Balcony.
Kitchen and Dining: Separate Dining area (100 x 86) and Kitchen (100 x 79) ensure that cooking and eating activities are defined and comfortable.
Master Bedroom Area: A cozy 120 x 110 sanctuary with an attached toilet (74 x 40) and balcony.
Storage Highlight: This unit features a massive Store room of 410 x 29, which is exceptionally long and provides incredible storage utility.

2 BHK Type 2 (The Kitchen Focused Layout)
This variant focuses on a different kitchen proportion for those who love cooking.
Living Room: Same massive 110 x 163 dimension (approx 180 sq ft).
Kitchen Area: Measures 100 x 710. Note the specific dimension here; it offers a different aspect ratio for modular kitchen setups.
Master Bedroom: Standard 120 x 110 size with an attached toilet (40 x 53).
Storage: Similar massive store room (410 x 30).

Amenities and Lifestyle
Our 14th Floor Clubhouse is the crown jewel of the project.

Open Meditation Area: Spanning 443 x 319, this colossal open-air deck offers ample space for morning yoga sessions for the entire community.
Ground Floor Conveniences: We have 22 Shops (Shops 1–22) within the complex, ensuring you don't have to leave the premises for milk, bread, or pharmacy needs.

Specifications and Quality
Structure: We use an Earthquake Resistant RCC Frame Structure to ensure maximum safety.
